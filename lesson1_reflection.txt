1.How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?


A: As some line/lines in next ver were introduced in next ver, & code has stopped working after that. Diff can help us to find those lines

2.How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?


A: we are able to change features easily while knowing which part of code does what & how it can effect entirely the software.

3.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?


A: some changes are minor enough to save & may use a lot of memory

4.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?



A:because in software coding , most of the time files are related one change in file can changes in other.

5.How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
A: we can always revert back to woring version if something break

6.Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
